# The-Distribution-Characteristics-of-Returns-in-China-s-Stock-Market
以上证指数为研究对象，采用不同时间尺度的收益率数据，探讨中国股市收益率的分布特征。通过描述性统计分析、概率分布计算及正态分布拟合，发现上证指数收益率分布具有尖峰肥尾的特征，且随着时间尺度的增加，分布越来越扩散。同时，利用K-S检验发现，收益率分布与正态分布存在显著偏离。进一步研究尾部特征，发现除240分钟和日度尺度外，其他时间尺度的收益率尾部分布呈现幂律关系，其中仅1分钟尺度的正尾和负尾满足负三次方定律。
The Shanghai Composite Index is used as the research object, and the return data of different time scales are used to explore the distribution characteristics of China's stock market returns. Through descriptive statistical analysis, probability distribution calculation and normal distribution fitting, it is found that the return distribution of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index has the characteristics of a sharp peak and a fat tail, and as the time scale increases, the distribution becomes more and more diffuse. At the same time, using the K-S test, it is found that the return distribution deviates significantly from the normal distribution. Further research on the tail characteristics reveals that except for the 240-minute and daily scales, the distribution of yield tails on other time scales exhibits a power-law relationship, and only the positive and negative tails on the 1-minute scale satisfy the negative cubic law.
